  <h1 align="center">Wantable App Redesign</h1>
  <p id="para">Wantable is a clothing subscription company based out of Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Their software stack primarily consists of Ruby on Rails, which doesn’t translate well in an app-based environment. The goal of this concept is to redesign the current app natively in Swift, make it more user friendly, and inject observable and fundamental changes to the overall user flow.<br><br>Some improvements include a dedicate profile section, a proper dock menu, and refined design guidelines (Such as button emphasis). </p>

      <h2>Home Screen Redesign</h2>
      <p class="para2">A main component of Wantable’s user interface is The Stream. The Stream is a curation of algorithmically selected clothes that the user may be interested in based on their initial Style Quiz they took when they signed up for the service. The current app, regardless if you are signed up for the service, brings you directly to the Stream. <br><br>The new welcome screen is not only more personable, but also allows the user to select where they want to go from the start instead of being thrust into the marketplace. If the user is not signed in, “Your Profile” and “Your Edits” would be replaced with sign in options. Either way, the user has the option to swipe up to go right into The Stream if they choose.

      <h2>Functional Stream</h2>
      <p class="para3">The Stream now becomes an endlessly scrolling column, similar to Instagram, that presents the user with everything they need to know about a certain product. This screen really hasn’t changed that much, but it’s readability is much improved. “Decline” has been replaced with “Not for me” for a more pleasant and personal conversation as well as an added “Share” button.
